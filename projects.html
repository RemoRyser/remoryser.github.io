            <h3>Main projects: Biodiversity - ecosystem functioning (BEF) relationships in multitrophic metacommunities (an SNF Ambizione project in colaboration with Eric Allan at UniBe)</h3>
            
            <p>This project aims to understand the complex relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF). While many studies show a generally positive link between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, this relationship is context-dependent. This project focuses on the context-dependency of BEF relationships, specifically in regard to multi-trophic interactions, eutrophication, and spatial processes and scales.</p>
            <p>To foster our understanding of BEF relationships and their context-dependency, this project combines empirical data from a large grassland experiment (<a href="https://allanecology.com/projects/pandiv/">PaNDiv project</a>) and grasslands in the Swiss Alps with a theoretical approach, e.g., bioenergetic food-web modeling. By integrating these methods, the project seeks to uncover the mechanisms driving BEF relationships and provide insights into questions such as optimal spatial configurations of plant communities for maximizing BEF. The ultimate goal is to develop a mechanistic understanding of BEF relationships that can be applied across different ecosystems and inform future ecological research and management practices.</p>

            <h2>Bioeconomics in fisheries</h2>
            <p>In this project, we combine bioenergetic food-web models with economic models to understand how ecological and economic dynamics interact and test how different fishing strategies affect ecological and economic stocks and yields and their stability.</p>

            <h2>sMars - Synthesis of Movement Across Scales (<a href="https://www.idiv.de/en/smars.html">an sDiv funded research group</a>):</h2>
            <img class="project-image" src="images/sMars.jpg" alt="sMars working group" width="500">
            <p>Movement is the key process driving species interactions, community composition, and ultimately biodiversity patterns across scales. However, the geographic scale of biodiversity research does not necessarily match the scale at which animals move and interact. Thus, we are developing an empirically informed unified concept of spatial scale that accounts for the differences in how species experience their spatial environment. Furthermore, we are compiling a general movement database and are developing a mechanistic dispersal model based on energy budgets and metabolism.</p>

            <h2>Artificial light at night (ALAN)</h2>
            <p>Artificial light has a major impact on nocturnal animals and plants and has hence gained increased attention from the global change research community. During my bachelor's and master's studies, I conducted extensive fieldwork on how artificial light impairs plant-pollinator networks. After receiving my PhD, I took up this interest again at iDiv. Here, we created a artificial light experiment (EcoLux) on the <a href="https://www.idiv.de/en/research/platforms-and-networks/idiv-ecotron.html">iDiv EcoTron experimental platform</a>. Due to the collaborative nature of the project, we were able to holistically measure ecosystem patterns and processes ranging from below-ground microbes to plants and invertebrates. This project furthermore sparked a thematic session at the BES2021 that I organized and chaired. Following this, I contributed to and edited a <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/toc/rstb/2023/378/1892">theme issue</a> on “Light pollution in complex ecological systems” for the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B.</p>

            
            <h2>Networks on Networks</h2>
            <p>During my PhD, I developed a bioenergetic meta-food-web model by extending an allometric trophic network model (ATN) into a spatially explicit framework by coupling local food-web dynamics on patches through dispersal. One, in my opinion, particularly interesting insight from this model was a mechanistic explanation of how habitat heterogeneity can foster biodiversity through the well-known rescue effect and its counterpart that we named the "drainage effect".</p>
